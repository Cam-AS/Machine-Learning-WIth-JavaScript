Problem Solving Process: 
 - Identify data that is relevant to the problem 
 - Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
 - Decide on the type of output you are expecting
 - Based on the type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your 'features' and 'labels'
 - Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction

Classification: 
 - The value of our labels belong to a discrete set

Regression:
 - The value of our labels belong to a continuous set


Algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbour (knn)
 - Birds of a feather flock together
